Note: since the file structure may changes a lot in later updates, currently I do not recommend to use Soda in production.

## Overview
Soda is a personal site generator inspired by [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo). It features creating portfolios and blogs using Markdown.

Soda is majorly written in [KotlinJS](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/js-overview.html) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) and currently in development. It is extensible. If you are unfamiliar with either or both of them, [Kotlin Hands-On](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Building%20Web%20Applications%20with%20React%20and%20Kotlin%20JS/01_Introduction) may be a good place to begin.

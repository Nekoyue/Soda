Note: since the file structure may changes a lot in future updates, I do not recommend to use Soda in production.

## Overview
Soda is a personal site generator inspired by [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo). It features creating portfolios and blogs using Markdown.

Soda is written in [KotlinJS](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/js-overview.html) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) and currently in development.
